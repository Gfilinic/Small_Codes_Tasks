# Small_Codes_Tasks
Repository for some of my code snippets and weekly tasks for the purpose of passing courses and practice. Folders should contain documents explaining the task.

<b>Other</b> folder contains more snippets but without appropriate document explaining the task, they are easy and small codes which are self-explantory upon launching.
